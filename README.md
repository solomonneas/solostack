> No fluff. No theory without implementation. Every guide documents what was actually deployed, how to verify it, and what broke along the way.

## Who This Is For

Engineers running OpenClaw on real infrastructure: bare metal, VPS, homelab, or enterprise. If you're managing an always-on AI agent that has access to your systems, you need to lock it down properly. These guides assume you're comfortable with Linux administration and want actionable steps, not blog posts.

## Guide Format

Every guide follows the same structure:

1. **What changed** and why
2. **Before/after** configurations
3. **Step-by-step** implementation
4. **Verification** commands you can run right now
5. **Gotchas** and implementation notes from real deployments

## Contributing
