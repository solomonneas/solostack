## What this is

This is a working cookbook for one specific stack: a single-engineer setup that runs an always-on multi-agent AI orchestrator on bare-metal Linux, with a homelab behind it for self-hosting, security tooling, content publishing, and knowledge management.

It is **not** a framework, not a product, not a tutorial series. It is a record of what is actually deployed, why each piece is shaped the way it is, and what broke along the way. Lift any single piece. Adopt the whole thing. Or use it as a counterexample. All three are valid.

The agent layer runs on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), but the patterns generalize. Most of the guides below would apply with light adaptation to [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/agnos-ai/hermes), Claude Code's agent SDK, or any orchestrator that wraps a real LLM with real tools.

## Recommended Provider Stack

The guides assume a specific provider mix. You can substitute, but if you want a known-good baseline:

- **Codex Pro ($200/mo) OAuth: main agent + coder.** This is the happy path. One flat subscription covers orchestration, code generation, and most cron work. Codex OAuth slots cleanly into OpenClaw's primary-model path and has been the most stable surface across the 2026.4.x releases. Start here.
- **Claude Opus via ACP: escalation only.** Resume, intel, design, review, humanize, academic work. Run it through the ACPX plugin, not as a direct OpenClaw provider.
- **Ollama (free): embeddings, commit messages, triage.** Local, fast, no round-trip.

### ⚠️ Do not route Claude Max OAuth directly through OpenClaw

As of April 2026, pointing an OpenClaw agent at your Claude Max subscription OAuth has two problems that make it a non-starter:

1. **Extra usage charges.** Anthropic started metering traffic that arrives through third-party harnesses against your subscription in ways that show up as additional usage on top of normal Max caps. You can burn through quota far faster than the same work would cost through the first-party Claude client.
2. **System-prompt-level blocking.** Claude detects that it's running inside a non-Anthropic harness and injects guidance that degrades behavior (refusals, hedging, dropping tool calls). Prompt-level workarounds don't stick.

**The only sensible path to Opus from OpenClaw is ACP.** The ACPX plugin launches the official Claude Code CLI as a subprocess. Anthropic's own client handles the OAuth handshake, so the usage accounting and system-prompt behavior stay normal. OpenClaw connects to it over the Agent Client Protocol and treats the session as an escalation sub-agent.

## Quick start

There is nothing to install. This is a collection of standalone guides. Pick the one that solves a problem you have right now:

- **[automation/cron-patterns.md](automation/cron-patterns.md)**: decide which layer (systemd, agent cron, n8n) each scheduled task in your stack actually belongs in
- **[ai-stack/multi-model-orchestration.md](ai-stack/multi-model-orchestration.md)**: wire one orchestrator across many models with the right model per task
- **[security/linux-hardening.md](security/linux-hardening.md)**: UFW, SSH hardening, fail2ban, and defense in depth for the host
- **[infrastructure/backup-recovery.md](infrastructure/backup-recovery.md)**: restic to NAS + cloud, twice daily, with snapshot mounts

## Who This Is For

Engineers running an always-on AI agent on real infrastructure: bare metal, VPS, homelab, or enterprise. If you have an agent that has access to your systems, you need to lock it down properly. These guides assume you're comfortable with Linux administration and want actionable steps, not blog posts.

> 🦞 *Built by an engineer who runs this stack 24/7 on bare metal and broke everything at least once so you don't have to.*

## Guide format

Every guide follows the same skeleton. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full template:

1. **What this is** and who it's for
2. **Why this way**: tradeoffs vs the obvious alternatives
3. **Prerequisites**
4. **Before / After**
5. **Implementation** with real commands
6. **Verification** commands you can run right now
7. **Gotchas** from real deployments
8. **Templates + Related** cross-links

Reference implementation: [`automation/cron-patterns.md`](automation/cron-patterns.md).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Two non-obvious rules:

1. **No personal hostnames or IPs in committed text.** Use generic terms.
2. **Every guide ends with a Gotchas section.** If nothing broke, the guide is incomplete.

A pre-push hook ships at [`hooks/pre-push`](hooks/pre-push) that runs [content-guard](https://github.com/solomonneas/content-guard) over the working tree to catch leaks before they hit the remote. Activate after cloning:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```
